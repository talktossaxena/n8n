# 🎓 Student Management AI Agent

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  📩 **The Trigger (Gmail):** 
    The workflow polls your Gmail account every minute for **unread emails**. When a new email arrives, it captures the sender, subject, and the body of the message.
2.  🧠 **The AI Brain (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**
    The email data is passed to an **AI Agent** powered by Anthropic's Claude model. This agent is programmed with specific "System Instructions" to act as a record manager. It has **Simple Memory**, meaning it can remember the context of a conversation within the same email thread.
3.  🛠️ **The Tools (Google Sheets):**
    The AI Agent doesn't just "think"—it has "hands." It is connected to three specific Google Sheets tools:
    *   **Get Rows:** To check if a student already exists (using their Roll Number).
    *   **Append Row:** To add a new student's details.
    *   **Delete Row:** To remove a student's record.
4.  📝 **The Processing Logic:**
    *   **"add student" subject:** The AI parses the Roll No, Name, Age, and Branch. It checks if the Roll No exists. If it's a duplicate, it refuses; if it's unique, it adds them to the sheet.
    *   **"delete student" subject:** The AI finds the student by Roll No and removes them.
    *   **Invalid subject:** It politely tells the sender that the request couldn't be processed.
5.  📧 **The Output (Gmail Reply):**
    Once the AI completes the task (or hits an error), it generates a professional response and sends it back as a **Gmail Reply** to the original sender.

# 📑 Zabbix Host List Exporter

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Trigger:** The workflow is started manually by clicking the **"Execute workflow"** button.
2.  📡 **API Fetch (List Zabbix Hosts):** It makes a `POST` request to your Zabbix API using JSON-RPC. It specifically asks for a list of all hosts currently configured in your system.
3.  ✂️ **Data Extraction (Hosts Split):** The API response usually comes back as one large object. This node "splits" that data so every individual host becomes its own separate item.
4.  ✏️ **Formatting (Update Column Names):** This node renames the raw technical fields from Zabbix to make them human-readable:
    *   `host` becomes **Host Name**
    *   `hostid` becomes **Host ID**
5.  📊 **File Creation:** it takes that cleaned list and converts it into a **.xlsx (Excel)** file named "Zabbix Hosts.xlsx."
6.  ✉️ **Email Delivery:** Finally, it sends an email to a specific admin address with the **Excel file attached**.

# 🛰️ Zabbix Monitoring Management

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Entry Point (Form Trigger):** 
    The workflow begins with a **Zabbix - Add / List Monitors** form. Users choose an action from a dropdown menu, such as adding a **URL**, **Port**, or **Database** (MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, Oracle) monitor, or listing current monitors.
2.  ⚖️ **The Switch:** 
    A **Switch Node** routes the request to one of **eight specific paths** based on the user's selection in the first step.
3.  📝 **Data Collection & File Handling:** 
    *   **Sub-Forms:** For "Add" actions, a secondary form asks for details like *Application Name*, *ASK ID*, and an Excel (`.xlsx`) template file containing the monitor configurations.
    *   **Local Storage:** The workflow saves these uploaded Excel files to a temporary disk location (`/tmp/`) to ensure the data is ready for processing.
4.  🛡️ **Confirmation Gate:** 
    Before changes are made, a **Switch Node** ("Create Monitors?") checks if the user selected **"Yes"** on the confirmation radio button. This prevents accidental executions.
5.  🚀 **Execution (Sub-workflows):** 
    If confirmed, the workflow triggers a specific **Sub-workflow** (e.g., *Add URL Monitors*) to handle the technical heavy lifting of interacting with the Zabbix API.
6.  📋 **Listing Monitors:** 
    For "List" actions, the workflow skips file saving and triggers sub-workflows that retrieve data from Zabbix and likely email a report back to the user.

# 🛰️ Zabbix - List WEB Monitors

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Trigger (Parent Workflow):** 
    This workflow is called by a "Parent" process that passes in an **Application Name** and an **Email ID**.
2.  🔡 **Name Variation Generator:** 
    Using a custom JavaScript node, it creates every possible case combination (UPPER, lower, Title Case, etc.) for the application name. This ensures that even if Zabbix has inconsistent naming (e.g., "App-One" vs "APP-ONE"), the workflow will find it.
3.  📡 **Multi-Stage Zabbix API Fetch:**
    *   **Host Get:** Searches Zabbix for hosts tagged with those application name variations.
    *   **HTTPTESTs Get:** For every host found, it retrieves all configured **Web Scenarios** (monitors), including steps, URLs, and retry settings.
    *   **Items & Triggers Get:** It goes even deeper to find the current **Last Value** (status) and the specific **Trigger Expressions** (the "alert rules") linked to those web monitors.
4.  📝 **Deep Data Formatting:** 
    The **Update Column Name** node contains complex logic to transform raw Zabbix JSON into a readable summary. It extracts:
    *   **Web Steps:** Details on every URL step (Timeout, Status Codes, POST data).
    *   **Triggers:** The severity and status of the alerts.
    *   **Tags:** Any metadata attached to the monitor.
5.  📊 **Excel Generation:** 
    All this data is flattened into a professional `.xlsx` file. The filename is dynamically set to the `Application Name`.
6.  ✉️ **Email Delivery:** 
    The Excel report is emailed to the requester and the Zabbix admin simultaneously.

# 🛰️ Zabbix - List Non-WEB Monitors

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **The Trigger (Parent Workflow):**
    The workflow is initiated by a central parent process, receiving an **Application Name** and a recipient **Email ID** as input.
2.  🔡 **Smart Name Matching:**
    It uses a JavaScript **Code Node** to generate every possible variation of the application name (UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, etc.). This ensures the workflow finds the monitoring data even if it was tagged inconsistently in Zabbix.
3.  📡 **Deep Zabbix Data Mining:**
    *   **Host Get:** Queries the Zabbix API to find all hosts tagged with the application's name.
    *   **Items Get:** For those hosts, it pulls every standard monitor (Zabbix agent, SNMP, SSH, Database monitors, etc.).
    *   **Trigger Expression:** It fetches the "Alert Rules" (Triggers) connected to those items to see exactly what thresholds will cause a notification.
4.  📝 **Human-Friendly Formatting:**
    The **Update Column Name** node translates raw technical data into readable text. It maps Zabbix numeric codes to clear labels, such as converting `Type: 0` into **"Zabbix agent"** and `Status: 0` into **"Enabled."**
5.  📊 **File Conversion & Delivery:**
    *   **Excel:** Bundles host names, monitor types, keys, and last recorded values into a professional `.xlsx` file.
    *   **Email:** The final report is automatically sent to the provided email address, providing a full inventory of the non-web monitoring status.
