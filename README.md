# 🎓 Student Management AI Agent

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  📩 **The Trigger (Gmail):** 
    The workflow polls your Gmail account every minute for **unread emails**. When a new email arrives, it captures the sender, subject, and the body of the message.
2.  🧠 **The AI Brain (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**
    The email data is passed to an **AI Agent** powered by Anthropic's Claude model. This agent is programmed with specific "System Instructions" to act as a record manager. It has **Simple Memory**, meaning it can remember the context of a conversation within the same email thread.
3.  🛠️ **The Tools (Google Sheets):**
    The AI Agent doesn't just "think"—it has "hands." It is connected to three specific Google Sheets tools:
    *   **Get Rows:** To check if a student already exists (using their Roll Number).
    *   **Append Row:** To add a new student's details.
    *   **Delete Row:** To remove a student's record.
4.  📝 **The Processing Logic:**
    *   **"add student" subject:** The AI parses the Roll No, Name, Age, and Branch. It checks if the Roll No exists. If it's a duplicate, it refuses; if it's unique, it adds them to the sheet.
    *   **"delete student" subject:** The AI finds the student by Roll No and removes them.
    *   **Invalid subject:** It politely tells the sender that the request couldn't be processed.
5.  📧 **The Output (Gmail Reply):**
    Once the AI completes the task (or hits an error), it generates a professional response and sends it back as a **Gmail Reply** to the original sender.

# 📑 Zabbix Host List Exporter

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Trigger:** The workflow is started manually by clicking the **"Execute workflow"** button.
2.  📡 **API Fetch (List Zabbix Hosts):** It makes a `POST` request to your Zabbix API using JSON-RPC. It specifically asks for a list of all hosts currently configured in your system.
3.  ✂️ **Data Extraction (Hosts Split):** The API response usually comes back as one large object. This node "splits" that data so every individual host becomes its own separate item.
4.  ✏️ **Formatting (Update Column Names):** This node renames the raw technical fields from Zabbix to make them human-readable:
    *   `host` becomes **Host Name**
    *   `hostid` becomes **Host ID**
5.  📊 **File Creation:** it takes that cleaned list and converts it into a **.xlsx (Excel)** file named "Zabbix Hosts.xlsx."
6.  ✉️ **Email Delivery:** Finally, it sends an email to a specific admin address with the **Excel file attached**.

<img width="1043" height="151" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f556e6cd-fcb9-49be-8b5b-a680b7d10946" />

# 🛰️ Zabbix Monitoring Management

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Entry Point (Form Trigger):** 
    The workflow begins with a **Zabbix - Add / List Monitors** form. Users choose an action from a dropdown menu, such as adding a **URL**, **Port**, or **Database** (MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, Oracle) monitor, or listing current monitors.
2.  ⚖️ **The Switch:** 
    A **Switch Node** routes the request to one of **eight specific paths** based on the user's selection in the first step.
3.  📝 **Data Collection & File Handling:** 
    *   **Sub-Forms:** For "Add" actions, a secondary form asks for details like *Application Name*, *ASK ID*, and an Excel (`.xlsx`) template file containing the monitor configurations.
    *   **Local Storage:** The workflow saves these uploaded Excel files to a temporary disk location (`/tmp/`) to ensure the data is ready for processing.
4.  🛡️ **Confirmation Gate:** 
    Before changes are made, a **Switch Node** ("Create Monitors?") checks if the user selected **"Yes"** on the confirmation radio button. This prevents accidental executions.
5.  🚀 **Execution (Sub-workflows):** 
    If confirmed, the workflow triggers a specific **Sub-workflow** (e.g., *Add URL Monitors*) to handle the technical heavy lifting of interacting with the Zabbix API.
6.  📋 **Listing Monitors:** 
    For "List" actions, the workflow skips file saving and triggers sub-workflows that retrieve data from Zabbix and likely email a report back to the user.

# 🛰️ Zabbix - List WEB Monitors

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **Trigger (Parent Workflow):** 
    This workflow is called by a "Parent" process that passes in an **Application Name** and an **Email ID**.
2.  🔡 **Name Variation Generator:** 
    Using a custom JavaScript node, it creates every possible case combination (UPPER, lower, Title Case, etc.) for the application name. This ensures that even if Zabbix has inconsistent naming (e.g., "App-One" vs "APP-ONE"), the workflow will find it.
3.  📡 **Multi-Stage Zabbix API Fetch:**
    *   **Host Get:** Searches Zabbix for hosts tagged with those application name variations.
    *   **HTTPTESTs Get:** For every host found, it retrieves all configured **Web Scenarios** (monitors), including steps, URLs, and retry settings.
    *   **Items & Triggers Get:** It goes even deeper to find the current **Last Value** (status) and the specific **Trigger Expressions** (the "alert rules") linked to those web monitors.
4.  📝 **Deep Data Formatting:** 
    The **Update Column Name** node contains complex logic to transform raw Zabbix JSON into a readable summary. It extracts:
    *   **Web Steps:** Details on every URL step (Timeout, Status Codes, POST data).
    *   **Triggers:** The severity and status of the alerts.
    *   **Tags:** Any metadata attached to the monitor.
5.  📊 **Excel Generation:** 
    All this data is flattened into a professional `.xlsx` file. The filename is dynamically set to the `Application Name`.
6.  ✉️ **Email Delivery:** 
    The Excel report is emailed to the requester and the Zabbix admin simultaneously.

<img width="997" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d49569a-c579-4ec8-92a3-f97bac6ec661" />

# 🛰️ Zabbix - List Non-WEB Monitors

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  🏁 **The Trigger (Parent Workflow):**
    The workflow is initiated by a central parent process, receiving an **Application Name** and a recipient **Email ID** as input.
2.  🔡 **Smart Name Matching:**
    It uses a JavaScript **Code Node** to generate every possible variation of the application name (UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, etc.). This ensures the workflow finds the monitoring data even if it was tagged inconsistently in Zabbix.
3.  📡 **Deep Zabbix Data Mining:**
    *   **Host Get:** Queries the Zabbix API to find all hosts tagged with the application's name.
    *   **Items Get:** For those hosts, it pulls every standard monitor (Zabbix agent, SNMP, SSH, Database monitors, etc.).
    *   **Trigger Expression:** It fetches the "Alert Rules" (Triggers) connected to those items to see exactly what thresholds will cause a notification.
4.  📝 **Human-Friendly Formatting:**
    The **Update Column Name** node translates raw technical data into readable text. It maps Zabbix numeric codes to clear labels, such as converting `Type: 0` into **"Zabbix agent"** and `Status: 0` into **"Enabled."**
5.  📊 **File Conversion & Delivery:**
    *   **Excel:** Bundles host names, monitor types, keys, and last recorded values into a professional `.xlsx` file.
    *   **Email:** The final report is automatically sent to the provided email address, providing a full inventory of the non-web monitoring status.

# Zabbix — Actions n8n Workflow

## Overview

This workflow provides a **web-based self-service portal** for managing Zabbix monitors. Users access a form via a browser, select the action they want to perform, fill in details, upload a template file, and the workflow automatically routes to the appropriate sub-workflow to create or list monitors in Zabbix.

It supports **6 monitor types** (URL, Port, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, Oracle) for adding monitors, and **2 listing actions** (Non-WEB and WEB monitors) — 8 actions in total.

---

## High-Level Flow

```

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Node-by-Node Breakdown

### 1. Zabbix — Add / List Monitors *(Form Trigger — Entry Point)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `formTrigger` |
| Form Title | Zabbix — Add / List Monitors |
| Path | `/zabbix-monitors` |
| Authentication | Basic Auth (`n8n basic auth`) |
| Button Label | Next |

The **entry point** of the entire workflow. Renders a web form with a dropdown menu where the user selects one of 8 actions:

**Add Actions:**
- Add — URL Availability Monitor
- Add — Port Availability Monitor
- Add — MySQL Database Availability Monitor
- Add — MSSQL Database Availability Monitor
- Add — Postgres Database Availability Monitor
- Add — Oracle Database Availability Monitor

**List Actions:**
- List — Non WEB Monitors for an Application
- List — WEB Monitors for an Application

The form description also provides download links for Excel templates (URL, Port, Database) that users must populate before uploading.

---

### 2. Switch *(Action Router)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `switch` |
| Input | `$json['Action to perform']` |
| Outputs | 8 branches (one per action) |

Routes the workflow to the correct branch based on the action selected in Step 1. Each of the 8 outputs connects to a different form or sub-workflow path.

| Output | Routes To |
|---|---|
| 0 | URL Monitors form |
| 1 | Port Monitors form |
| 2 | MySQL Monitors form |
| 3 | MSSQL Monitors form |
| 4 | Postgres Monitors form |
| 5 | Oracle Monitors form |
| 6 | Non WEB Monitors form |
| 7 | WEB Monitors form |

---

### 3. Monitor Detail Forms *(6 Add Forms + 2 List Forms)*

#### Add Monitor Forms (URL / Port / MySQL / MSSQL / Postgres / Oracle)

Each "Add" action shows a second form collecting the following details:

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Application Name | Text | ✅ |
| Application Alias Name | Text | ✅ |
| Application ASK ID | Text | ✅ |
| Monitor Template File | File upload (.xlsx only) | ✅ |
| Email ID to send approval link | Text (comma-separated) | ✅ |
| Are you sure to create monitors? | Radio (Yes / No, default: No) | ✅ |

The form title is dynamically set to the selected action name from Step 1.

#### List Monitor Forms (Non WEB / WEB)

Simpler form with only two fields:

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Application Name | Text | ✅ |
| Email ID to send items list | Text (comma-separated) | ✅ |

---

### 4. Write Template File to Disk *(Add paths only)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `readWriteFile` |
| Operation | Write |
| File Path | `/tmp/workflow-{executionId}-{submittedAt}.xlsx` |
| Data Source | `Monitor_Template_File` (from form upload) |

After form submission, the uploaded `.xlsx` template file is saved to disk at a unique path using the execution ID and submission timestamp. This file is later consumed by the sub-workflow to read monitor definitions.

One write node exists per monitor type (URL, Port, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, Oracle) — 6 total.

---

### 5. Create [Type] Monitors? *(Confirmation Gate)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `switch` |
| Condition | `Are you sure to create monitors?` == `Yes` |

A safety gate that only proceeds if the user confirmed **"Yes"** in the form. If the user selected "No", the workflow stops here — no monitors are created. This prevents accidental submissions.

One confirmation switch exists per monitor type — 6 total.

---

### 6. Execute Sub-Workflows

#### Add Monitor Sub-Workflows

Each monitor type calls a dedicated sub-workflow to actually create the monitors in Zabbix:

| Node Name | Sub-Workflow Called | Workflow ID |
|---|---|---|
| Add URL Monitors | Zabbix — Add URL Monitors | `Q4G8AkGRF55wQbIA` |
| Add Port Monitors | Zabbix — Add Port Monitors | `aFL7AQzqPtaFqPeZ` |
| Add MySQL Monitors | Zabbix — Add MySQL Monitors | `q6bomJ7EJhP2sPxx` |
| Add MSSQL Monitors | Zabbix — Add MSSQL Monitors | `AIBErE1YtLTXMWEu` |
| Add Postgres Monitors | Zabbix — Add Postgres Monitors | `3oCIzo1VrAd5342E` |
| Add Oracle Monitors | Zabbix — Add Oracle Monitors | `zZ3Bin1WHzQ1cL7Q` |

#### List Monitor Sub-Workflows

| Node Name | Sub-Workflow Called | Workflow ID |
|---|---|---|
| List Non WEB Monitors | Zabbix — List Non WEB Monitors | `8ll20oXUS1mvRiXT` |
| List WEB Monitors | Zabbix — List WEB Monitors | `171V6VKgPBI2jIYJ` |

All sub-workflows are called with `waitForSubWorkflow: false`, meaning this workflow fires and moves on without waiting for the sub-workflow to finish.

---

## Complete Flow per Action Type

### Adding a Monitor (e.g., URL)

```
User opens /zabbix-monitors
        ↓
Selects "Add - URL Availability Monitor" → clicks Next
        ↓
Fills in: App Name, Alias, ASK ID, uploads .xlsx, enters emails
Selects "Yes" to confirm → clicks Submit
        ↓
Uploaded .xlsx file written to /tmp/workflow-{id}.xlsx
        ↓
Switch checks: "Yes" → proceeds / "No" → stops
        ↓
Calls sub-workflow: "Zabbix - Add URL Monitors"
```

### Listing Monitors (e.g., WEB)

```
User opens /zabbix-monitors
        ↓
Selects "List - WEB Monitors for an Application" → clicks Next
        ↓
Fills in: App Name, Email IDs → clicks Submit
        ↓
Calls sub-workflow: "Zabbix - List WEB Monitors"
```

---

## Credentials Required

| Credential | Used By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `n8n basic auth` | Form Trigger | Protects the form with username/password |

---

## Workflow Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **Inactive** |
| Execution Order | v1 |

> ⚠️ The workflow is currently **inactive**. It must be activated before the form URL becomes accessible.

---

## Dependent Sub-Workflows

This workflow acts as an **orchestrator**. It collects user input and delegates actual Zabbix operations to 8 separate sub-workflows. All sub-workflows must exist and be active for this workflow to function correctly.

| Sub-Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Zabbix — Add URL Monitors | Creates URL availability monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — Add Port Monitors | Creates port availability monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — Add MySQL Monitors | Creates MySQL DB monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — Add MSSQL Monitors | Creates MSSQL DB monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — Add Postgres Monitors | Creates Postgres DB monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — Add Oracle Monitors | Creates Oracle DB monitors in Zabbix |
| Zabbix — List Non WEB Monitors | Lists non-web monitors for an application |
| Zabbix — List WEB Monitors | Lists web monitors for an application |

---

## Notes

- The form is accessible at the path `/zabbix-monitors` and is protected by Basic Auth to prevent unauthorized access.
- Template files (`.xlsx`) are temporarily stored in `/tmp/` with unique filenames per execution to avoid conflicts.
- The **"Are you sure?"** confirmation radio (default: No) acts as a safeguard against accidental monitor creation.
- Emails collected in the forms are passed to sub-workflows, which presumably send approval links or result lists to those addresses.
- Sub-workflows run asynchronously (`waitForSubWorkflow: false`), so the form returns immediately without waiting for Zabbix operations to complete.

# AI Agent Email Assistant — n8n Workflow

## Overview

This workflow builds a **conversational AI-powered email assistant** accessible via a chat interface. Users can instruct the assistant in plain language to send emails, read emails, forward emails, or look up customer contact information — and the AI Agent handles everything autonomously using the tools at its disposal.

---

        │
        └──── Tool: Send Email (Gmail)
                  └─ Send / read / forward emails
```

---

## Node-by-Node Breakdown

### 1. When chat message received *(Chat Trigger)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `chatTrigger` |
| Webhook ID | `e8bf2b88-207f-482a-8179-d06256dc474b` |

The **entry point** of the workflow. Exposes an n8n chat interface where the user types instructions in natural language, such as:

- *"Send an email to John about the meeting tomorrow"*
- *"Read my latest emails"*
- *"Forward the last email from Sarah to Mike"*

Each message triggers the AI Agent to process the request and decide which tools to use.

---

### 2. AI Agent

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `agent` (LangChain) |
| Model | OpenAI Chat Model (gpt-5-mini) |
| Memory | Simple Memory (buffer window) |
| Tools | Customer Database, Send Email |

The **brain** of the workflow. Receives the user's chat message, reasons about what needs to be done, and autonomously calls the appropriate tools in the right order.

**System Prompt instructions:**
- Role: Personal assistant AI Agent
- Primary task: Handle all email-related actions
- Must **always look up the Customer Database first** before sending or reading emails (to resolve names to email addresses)
- Emails must be **professional** with clear structure and line breaks
- Always signs off as:
  ```
  Best regards,
  Ssinha
  ```
- Has access to the **current date** via `{{ $now.format('DD') }}` injected at runtime

**Tool usage logic (enforced via system prompt):**

```
User asks to email "John"
        ↓
Agent calls: Customer Database → finds john@example.com
        ↓
Agent calls: Send Email → sends to john@example.com
        ↓
Agent replies to chat: "Email sent to John successfully."
```

---

### 3. OpenAI Chat Model

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `lmChatOpenAi` |
| Model | `gpt-5-mini` |
| Credential | OpenAI account |
| Connection | `ai_languageModel` → AI Agent |

Provides the language intelligence for the AI Agent. Processes the user's natural language input and the agent's internal reasoning to decide on tool calls and generate responses.

---

### 4. Simple Memory

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `memoryBufferWindow` |
| Connection | `ai_memory` → AI Agent |

Maintains a **sliding window of conversation history** so the AI Agent can remember context across multiple messages in the same session. This enables multi-turn conversations such as:

> User: *"Send an email to Sarah about the project update."*
> Agent: *"Email sent!"*
> User: *"Now forward it to Mike too."* ← Agent remembers the context

---

### 5. Send Email *(Gmail Tool)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `gmailTool` |
| Credential | Gmail OAuth2 account |
| Connection | `ai_tool` → AI Agent |

A Gmail-connected tool that the AI Agent calls to handle all email actions. All parameters are dynamically filled by the AI using `$fromAI()`:

| Parameter | Source |
|---|---|
| `To` | AI-determined recipient address |
| `Subject` | AI-generated subject line |
| `Message` | AI-composed email body |

The AI formats the email body with proper structure, line breaks, and always appends the sign-off defined in the system prompt.

---

### 6. Customer Database *(Google Sheets Tool)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | `googleSheetsTool` |
| Spreadsheet | `customer database` |
| Sheet | `Sheet1` |
| Spreadsheet ID | `1pIxSsNXPD2B4gk-8olmPo0NvTzle6CRUfGV_CK5OF2I` |
| Credential | Google Sheets OAuth2 account |
| Connection | `ai_tool` → AI Agent |

A Google Sheets-backed tool that acts as a **contact directory**. The AI Agent queries this sheet to look up:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Any other contact information stored in the sheet

The system prompt enforces that this tool is **always called first** before any email action, ensuring the agent resolves contact names to actual email addresses rather than guessing.

---

## Credentials Required

| Credential | Node | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI account** | OpenAI Chat Model | API key for GPT model inference |
| **Gmail OAuth2** | Send Email | Send, read, and forward Gmail emails |
| **Google Sheets OAuth2** | Customer Database | Read contact information from Google Sheets |

---

## Example Conversations

### Sending an email by name
```
User:  "Send an email to Alice about the Q3 report being ready."

Agent: [calls Customer Database → finds alice@company.com]
       [calls Send Email → composes and sends professional email]
       "Done! I've sent an email to Alice (alice@company.com)
        letting her know the Q3 report is ready."
```

### Reading emails
```
User:  "Do I have any new emails from Bob?"

Agent: [calls Customer Database → finds bob@company.com]
       [calls Send Email (read mode) → fetches emails from Bob]
       "You have 2 unread emails from Bob. The latest one is
        about the contract review dated today."
```

### Forwarding an email
```
User:  "Forward the last email from Bob to the finance team."

Agent: [calls Customer Database → finds finance team email]
       [calls Send Email → forwards the email]
       "Forwarded Bob's last email to the finance team."
```

---

## Workflow Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **Inactive** |
| Execution Order | v1 |
| Binary Mode | separate |
| Workflow ID | `otoM2GoZweMgJYcJ` |

> ⚠️ The workflow is currently **inactive**. Activate it to make the chat interface live.

---

## Setup Checklist

Before activating this workflow, ensure the following are configured:

- [ ] **OpenAI API key** connected under *OpenAI account* credential
- [ ] **Gmail OAuth2** authorized under *Gmail account* credential
- [ ] **Google Sheets OAuth2** authorized under *Google Sheets account* credential
- [ ] **Customer database spreadsheet** (`Sheet1`) populated with contact names, emails, and phone numbers
- [ ] Update the sign-off name in the system prompt (`Ssinha`) to the correct sender name

---

## Notes

- The agent uses `gpt-5-mini` — swap to `gpt-4o` for more complex reasoning or longer email chains.
- The **Simple Memory** node uses a buffer window, meaning it retains only the last N messages. For very long sessions, earlier context may be forgotten.
- The current date is injected into the system prompt using `{{ $now.format('DD') }}` — only the day number. Consider extending this to `$now.format('DD MMM YYYY')` for full date context.
- The `Customer Database` tool is read-only as configured — it looks up contacts but does not write back to the sheet.
- Email actions (send, read, forward) are all handled by the single **Gmail tool** node, with the AI deciding the action based on context.
