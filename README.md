# 🎓 Student Management AI Agent

### 🛠️ **How it works**

1.  📩 **The Trigger (Gmail):** 
    The workflow polls your Gmail account every minute for **unread emails**. When a new email arrives, it captures the sender, subject, and the body of the message.
2.  🧠 **The AI Brain (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**
    The email data is passed to an **AI Agent** powered by Anthropic's Claude model. This agent is programmed with specific "System Instructions" to act as a record manager. It has **Simple Memory**, meaning it can remember the context of a conversation within the same email thread.
3.  🛠️ **The Tools (Google Sheets):**
    The AI Agent doesn't just "think"—it has "hands." It is connected to three specific Google Sheets tools:
    *   **Get Rows:** To check if a student already exists (using their Roll Number).
    *   **Append Row:** To add a new student's details.
    *   **Delete Row:** To remove a student's record.
4.  📝 **The Processing Logic:**
    *   **"add student" subject:** The AI parses the Roll No, Name, Age, and Branch. It checks if the Roll No exists. If it's a duplicate, it refuses; if it's unique, it adds them to the sheet.
    *   **"delete student" subject:** The AI finds the student by Roll No and removes them.
    *   **Invalid subject:** It politely tells the sender that the request couldn't be processed.
5.  📧 **The Output (Gmail Reply):**
    Once the AI completes the task (or hits an error), it generates a professional response and sends it back as a **Gmail Reply** to the original sender.
